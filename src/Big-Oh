printReceiptInOrder:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Iterates through the cartItems ArrayList to print each item and calculate the subtotal. The time taken is directly proportional to the number of items in the cart, denoted as n.

emptyCartReverseOrder:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Removes items from the cartItems ArrayList one by one until it is empty. Each removal operation takes constant time, but since it processes all n items, the overall time complexity is O(n).
